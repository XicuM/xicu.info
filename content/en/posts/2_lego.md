The CAT16x is the sixteenth single-seater built by BCN eMotorpsort, a team of engineering students I had the privilege of being part of during my university years.

The CAT16x was unveiled at the Rollout event in 2024. For this special occasion, I designed a Lego model of the CAT16x to be presented as a gift to our sponsors and university representatives.

The main reason for creating the Lego model was to offer our sponsors a tangible memory from the event. These sponsors have supported the team over the years, and we wanted to express our gratitude by giving them something unique. The Lego model served as the perfect token—a miniature replica of the real car, designed to be displayed on a desk or shelf as a symbol of our continuous collaboration.

On a personal note, the Lego model holds a special meaning for me. It represents the countless hours I spent playing with Lego as a child, and the endless creativity those moments sparked. That passion eventually grew into a genuine interest in technology and inspired me to pursue a career in engineering.
