After two incredible years with [BCN eMotorsport](bcnemotorsport.upc.edu), it’s time to say goodbye. From my first year and a half working on developing our inverter to this past year as a Team Leader, it has been an unforgettable journey.

Leading the team and managing the organizational side was both a challenge and a privilege. It taught me invaluable lessons about responsibility—what it truly means to be accountable for the team's actions, owning both the successes and the (many) failures. 

I also understood the value of each teammate's contribution and the importance of effective communication, striving every day to inspire and motivate them. Even when the odds were against us, we believed that achieving a great result was possible, and that belief is what kept us moving forward, enabling us to complete the Endurance event and achieve first place in the Driverless category at FS Spain.

I’m incredibly proud of everything we accomplished together: the technical challenges we overcame, the countless hours we dedicated to perfect the car, the friendships I made and the memories we created together. 

Though my time with the team has ended, I’m confident that the future holds even greater success for BCN eMotorsport. Keep pushing boundaries and evolving into the future!
