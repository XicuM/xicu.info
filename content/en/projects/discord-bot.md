**discord-bot** is a simple Discord bot designed to gamify the server of *La Caverna EclÃ©ctica*. The bot responds to various commands and acts based on the channel where the user is located.

In response to the Covid-19 crisis, I created *La Caverna EclÃ©ctica* in late 2020 as a means to communicate with my friends and foster ideas and creativity among them, thus creating a fun and modern online community. With this goal in mind, different activities are organized on the Discord server, including:

- The **weekly program** (:warning: INTERRUPTED): A weekly program of up to 4 participants discussing various topics. Members can sign up for the participant list using a bot command.

- The **workroom**: A virtual space where members connect to keep each other company while working on their personal projects. It is inspired by the workroom created by Jaime Altozano on his Discord server. As time passes in the room, the bot awards points to the members and assigns roles based on their activity:
  - **nini** (not working not studying): less than 1 hour.
  - **novice**: between 1 and 2 hours.
  - **initiated**: between 2 and 6 hours.
  - **padawan**: between 6 and 24 hours.
  - **entrepreneur**: between 24 and 120 hours.
  - **businessman**: between 120 and 720 hours.
  - **magnate**: between 720 and 5040 hours.
  - **life master**: more than 5040 hours.

In addition to assisting members in the weekly program and the workroom, the bot also sends a welcome message to new members.
